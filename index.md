#### **Vice President of Research and Development of SHUKUN Technology**

Email: weiyc at shukun.net

I joined [SHUKUN](https://www.shukun.net/) Technology on November, 2021. Before that, I was the director of [Megvii](https://www.megvii.com/) (Face++) Research Shanghai for 3 years and a researcher in Visual Computing group, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) (MSRA) for 12 years. I received my Ph.D degree in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2006, and B.S. degree in Peking University in 2001, respectively.

My research interests include deep learning and computer vision.

My [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&pli=1&user=O7A6nYMAAAAJ) citation is about 23,000, h-index is 48.

My work in MSRA has been transferred to [Kinect Identity in XBox](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5742015/), [Windows Hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AsoSnOmhvU), [Microsoft Cognitive Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/), Bing, Office, and Microsoft XiaoIce, etc.
